<Issues>
Type 3: Websites that only work with elementClickedOn for login entrypoitns

quizlet: The target DOM elements appear only when clicked on 'login' button on main page. --> Failed because the bot was constantly redirected to the Korean website.

Type 4: Other extra issues

<ip block>

angellist: ip blocks if too many login requests are fired in a rather short period of time

cloudflare: seems to blocks bots

doordash: Like angellist, the website apparently seems to ip block bots. (ip 밴은 하는데, 이게 로그인이랑 사인업 자체를 막는 것이지 사이트가 열리긴 한다. 그래서 체크는 가능할 듯?)

ebay: Like above, ebay seems to block bots as well

<captcha>

zipcar: Requires captcha when accessing login or signup page




<partially ready>
asana, avodocs, brex, calendly, deel, flickr, mixpanel, postgresql, webflow, wework


<website change>
twitch: MAJOR change on website, so major update on config file seems inevitable
